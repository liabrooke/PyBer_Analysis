# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
###### We are helping PyBer, a ride-sharing app. We analyzed ride-sharing data and narrowed it down to type of city, to show how the number of drivers, number of rides, and average fare differs depending on the city type. Using this data, PyBer will improve access and affordability to more cities. 
## Results
###### The PyBer Summary DataFrame showed the drastic difference between the three types of cities. While urban cities had over two thousand drivers, rural cities didn't even have 100.  For rural cities, this meant only 125 total rides compared to 1,625 rides in urban cities. This low supply of rural city drivers seemed to shoot the price of the average fare up, jumping just over $10 from the urban city counterpart ($24.53 to $34.62). Suburban cities, being in the middle with 490 total drivers (equating to 625 total rides), was also in the middle regarding average fare per ride ($30.97)

## Summary
### First recommendation
###### To help with affordability in rural cities, implement extra ride-sharing practices such as group fares or delayed time for pick-up. So for example, if two or three different riders are taking a similar route, the app can match them up together so that their overall fare ends up being lower since it's getting split. For the delayed time for pick-up, a rider can input into the app if their time leaving/arrive is flexible, and therefore if they choose to wait 10-20 minutes, their fare ends up being cheaper.
### Second recommendation
###### Recruit existing infrastructure competitors, such as taxis or limousines, to team up with PyBer when needed. Create a deal with these companies to enlist their services, such as when surges are high in some areas or during events. For example, instead of a regular ride-sharing driver in their personal car picking up riders, it would be a taxi cab, still ordered through the PyBer app. Implementing their help, whether it be planned or unexpectedly, can ensure that surge prices don't go through the roof and riders can still afford to use the ride-sharing app.
### Third recommendation
###### Forecast big events (concerts, festivals, sports games, etc), and recruit PyBer drivers from neighboring cities. For example, if there's a music festival happening in Los Angeles, identify consistent PyBer drivers located in neighboring cities to Los Angeles. Reach out to these neighboring drivers & ask if they can commit to certain time blocks during the event, where they drive into the city (Los Angeles in this example) to help with this increased demand. There will be an incentive for them to commit and participate in these busy times, which will help keep fares low for riders.
